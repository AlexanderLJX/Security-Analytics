    "email": "re : banning of german while flipping through random books at the linguistics library , i fell over something that would be interesting to this discussion . i have n't been following this thread , so this might have been mentioned before . i found a reference to the us supreme court reports , 1922 october term , meyer vs . nebraska , p . 392 - - 403 in steinberg ( 1993 ) an introduction to psycholinguistics , longman . i ' ll quote the passage in full , as it is so well written . it 's in the beginning of chapter 8 . \" in may of 1920 , in hamilton county , nebraska , a rural area of the united states , a teacher , mr robert meyer , was arrested for violating state law . mayer had been teaching bible stories in german at zion parochial school to a 10 - year-old boy . nebraska law forbade the teaching of a second language to children under the age of 13 . not only nebraska but 21 other states as well prohibited the teaching of foreign languages , except 'd ead ' languages such as latin and greek . according to nebraska 's 1919 siman act , ' no person . . . shall teach any subject to any person in any language other than the english language . languages other than english may be taught only after a pupil shall have . . . passed the eighth grade . . . . any person who violates any of the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and , upon conviction , shall be subject to a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars ( $ 25 ) , nor more than one hundred dollars ( $ 100 ) or be confined in the county jail for any period not exceeding thirty days for each offense . ' if found guilty , meyer could have been fined or even sent to jail . the states had passed these laws essentially with the german language as the target , america had just finished a war with germany and there was a hatred of germany and things german , particularly its military values , ideals and political institutions . the law reflected the widespread belief that the german language was the embodiment of all that was evil in german culture and that to teach such a language to young americans would be immoral and corrupting . meyer decided to appeal his case to the supreme court of the state of nebraska . ironically , lawyers for the state of nebraska took essentially the position presented in the german language by the german philosopher , wilhelm von humboldt , in 1836 . that is , a language by its very nature represents the spirit and national character of a people . if this were true , then by teaching them the grammar , structure and vocabulary of the german language , meyer could indeed have been harming american children by making them into german militarists right there on the plains of nebraska . the nebraska supreme court denied meyer 's appeal , but meyer did not submit . he then took his case to the highest court in the country , the united states supreme court , where he won his case . that court overturned his conviction and declared unconstitutional all laws in the united states which forbade the teaching of a foreign language . in its 1922 ruling the court stated as one basis for its decision . ' mere knowledge of the german language cannot reasonably be regarded as harmful . ' we see in this story that a seemingly purely theoretical issue can have very practical consequences in everyday life . in making a legal decision on the matter , the court also made a psycholinguistic decision , on the relationship of language , thought and culture . was the court correct ? it is this question that we shall now consider .

The deposit is still intact with my bank and the interest is being paid into the principal sum at the end of each year.\n\nIf the fund remains in the account for more months, the fund will be confiscated and transferred into the treasury of the Government as unclaimed funds. This is why I contact you for joining hands with the honesty and truth to ensure that the fund is transferred into your bank account, a bank account anywhere in the world can help the transfer. All that is required of you is to contact my bank with the information I will send you as the next of kin or a business associate of the depositor with this system the fund will be paid into a bank account you will provide to the bank. To be honest with you, this is totally legal and 100% risk free.\n\nBut the secret must remain between you and me, I can assure you that I have worked with this bank for many years and I know all the secrets and I have carefully mapped out my perfect strategies to handle this operation successfully. The depositor is my close friend before his death that is the main reason why I'm the only one working at the bank here that knows much about the existence of this fund and the secrets and the depositor. We will also use some part of the funds to help the orphanage and less privileged children in the world.\n\nPlease keep this proposal as a secret between us and delete it immediately in your mail box if you are not interested. But if you are interested give me an answer immediately.\n\nI await your response. Mr. Gilbson Mouka.",

    "email": "Dearest\nI am more than happy in your reply to my mail today,How are you today hope all is well and fine? mine is a little bit hot over here in Dakar Senegal.just like i told you in my first mail that i'm from ivory-coast, but due to the war in my country, that cost the dead of my father and my mother which made me to stay hear as a refugees. my condition here is terrible Its just like one staying in the prison and i hope by Gods grace i will come out here soon.i don't have any relatives now whom i can go to all our relatives ran away in the middle of the war the only person i have now is (Rev Father Paul Frank). who is the pastor of the (Christ the king Churches) here in the camp,he has been very nice to me since i came here but i am not living with him rather i'm leaving in the women's hostel(in the camp) because here they  have two hostels one for the men the other for women.The Pastors Tel number is  ( +221-762-946-201) if you call and tell him that you want to speak with me he will send for me in the hostel because of my condition here i don't have any right or privilege to some things be it money or whatever because it is against the law of this country.I want to go back to my studies because i only attended my first year before the tragic incident that lead to my being in this situation now took place. Please listen to this,i have my late father's statement of account and death certificate (as his next of kin)here with me which i will send to you latter,because when he was alive he deposited some amount of money in a leading bank in United kingdom which he used my name as the next of kin,the amount in question is $7.5m(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) So what i need from you is, for you to see that this money is transferred to  a good account and also to make arrangement on how i will come over and stay with you and continue my life and education. My choosing you is a question i knew you must ask and i think it is a good question.i have two reasons for choosing you, i choosed you because it is the will of  God.and i believe knowing you will bring hope back again to my life.my choosing you does not mean i do not have anybody from Africa.i have two uncles,that is my late fathers junior brothers whom i think are suppose to be taking care of me but they do not care,all they did was to sell my late father's houses and company to one Mr Olson Steven from united states and enjoy the money with their wives. I wanted to tell Olson about it but should my uncles know of the money,they can kill me ,so as to eat the money,it was as if my father saw their deed because he told the implication of having a big money in Africa and that was the reason while he made the deposit in Scotland.the day i wrote you first,i picked up three address from a dating site and i prayed over it with my Rev,father.he broth a pieces of paper and wrote the three email address in it and fold it,he ask me to pick one and i picked your email address,then i decided to write you and i also believe that it is the will of God. However you can call me with the reverend office phone line, my favorite language is English but our official language is French ,but i speak English very fluently because i attended an American and English speaking private school in my country for almost all my school,I will like you to send me some of your pictures and also try to call me as requested so that we can hear each other voices,i have a lot to tell,i will be thinking about you so much,as i will be waiting to hear from you soonest,\nhave a wonderful day,\nMiss Jessica.",

I hope that we can establish relationship and business partnership together. Actually,there is a personal financial transaction that I would want us to handle which will be profitable for both of us.\n\nAs the regional auditor manager of the Hong Leong Bank Malaysia, it is my obligation to send in a financial report to my head office in the capital city (Kuala Lumpur ) at the end of every year. On the course of the last two years end of the year report 2012, I discovered that my branch in which I am the manager made Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars [8, 500,000.00] which my head office is not aware of and will never be aware of it. I have since placed this fund on what we call SUSPENSE ACCOUNT without any beneficiary but I discovered at last that it was an excess profit from our bank which nobody is aware of.\n\nAs an official of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this fund so I finally came in conclusion of contacting you for us to carry out the deal together so that you can assist me and receive this fund into your bank account for us to share. Meanwhile, you will have 50% of the total fund. Note that there are practically no risk involved, it will be bank to bank transfer.\n\nAll I desire from you is to stand claim as the original depositor of this fund who made the deposit with our branch so that my head office can order the transfer to your designated bank account with my recommendation as officer in-charge.

Before his death, he deposited the sum of {7.100,000.00 million US Dollar} with a bank and this fund is presently with the bank awaiting my disbursement as  beneficiary and next of kin to the funds. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 4 months due to cancer Problem. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a Charity organization or good person that will use this fund to build an orphanage home which was the dream of my late husband. l took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit his money. I kept this deposit secret till date; this is why I am taking this decision. I don't think I will need any telephone communication in this regard because of the confidentiality of this transfer. Upon your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank. I will also issue a letter of authorization to the bank that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money.\n\nI am very grateful to you for the interest shown in my plight and I want to assure you that you will be greatly rewarded for what you have chosen to do. Although we are knowing each other for the first time but I believe God has directed me to you as I prayed and searched over the internet for assistance because I saw your profile on Microsoft EMAIL owners list and picked you. Be assured you stand no risk as this is my money, I and my late husband labored for it and me as the next of kin has the sole power to donate the funds to whoever I want. I am a religious women and take delight only in the things of God and I have prayed a lot on this already and I believe so much in the manifestation of God that I know he will not fail me and I want you to know that you have to be strong in your faith as he {God} will surely strengthen you. My husband's relatives will misuse this fund because they have sold my entire late husband's wealth and property left behind. they have sold virtually all we have in Australia, Mal\n\nAll I need is your absolute trust, commitment, confidentiality and honesty because I want to see my late husband's vision fulfilled before I leave this sinful world. My spirit directed me to you as I prayed and searched over the internet for someone to help me since I can no longer trust my family members and friends and I do not want this particular deposit to be used for things of the world. I will want you to get back to me that you will be absolutely honest about this transaction and you will use this money to the Glory of God. Also you have to assure me you will keep this transaction confidential and you will be willing to contact the finance firm which is located in (United Kingdom) and finalize all necessary formalities as to the release of the fund to you.\n\nI will also want to know a little more about you regarding your life, your spiritual life what you do for a living so as for me to know you well. I require your urgent response, if you are trustworthy and willing to help me finalize this transaction that I will immediately write my chamber to prepare a court injunction/power of attorney making you beneficiary to my fund ,some copy of other documents are with the finance firm as I sent it to them for safe keeping so my family members will not lay their hands on it. To prepare this document I will require your full names and full address. With this document you will contact the finance firm to arrange the transfer of the fund to you. As soon as you have received the fund then you will help me set up charity or distribute it to charity organizations and hospitals. I pray to be alive when you receive this fund and start this project so that you can visit me here if you wish to.\n\nI will be very happy if you can stand and fulfill this work of God wish you have been called to do.\n\nRegards\nMrs. Susan White",

    "email": "FOREIGN PAYMENTS DEPARTMENT\nSt James's Park Underground Station\n55 Broadway London SW1H 0BD United Kingdom\nTel/Fax: 44-702 409 3646\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFirst we wish to thank you for your immediate response regarding the transfer of $7,900,000.00 (Seven Million Nine Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) only which Mr. Tim Mallet of Ontario Canada claims to be your true representative.\n\nNote that we have had several attempts by some people to divert the funds from your name to their names and all claimed that they were sent by you and when we request for the documents issued to them by you, they never return back.\n\nWe made this contact to you believing that you will use this opportunity to help us serve you better. So much have been said and done on this particular payment and because you have not been here personally to sort this issue out, a lot of top officials have used that opportunity to trade with your payment thereby making so much profit at the New York Stock Exchange. Your payment has long been approved for transfer to you but because of the greed that exist in the lives of the Directors and top officials in Africa and parts of Europe, they have refused to release the funds to you because they are making profit with it from the stock trade.\n\nThis was confirmed by the HM treasury of the United Kingdom and immediately, a recall was placed for the funds to be repatriated for onward transfer to the actual Beneficiaries and that prompted us to contact you for your transfer. Note importantly that most Beneficiaries are not even aware that they have funds left somewhere. Some as a result of lottery, inheritance funds which was traced to their root from the Holocaust Victims.\n\nThe above sum is scheduled to be in your account before the next 72 hours from now only if you will adhere to our advice and instructions. Note that these people involved are working seriously to have the funds in their possession and we believe that it will be your duty to work harder and make sure that what is due to you is released to your account without any further delay.\n\nThe above amount is what has been approved to be paid to you and we advice you to accept it either as full payment or part payment now that it is available as many have ended up not receiving a dime after much time and efforts. Our office is dedicated to serving you as we have been mandated to make sure that all Beneficiaries who comply with the directives are paid without any further delay. This transfer has been proven legal and all legal documents will be processed and issued in your name as the final recipient and after that is done, no one will be able to lay claims on the funds.\n\nThe most important aspect is the communication areas which must be effective by telephone and email until transfer is made to your account as you are not to allow anyone have information of your payment to avoid any double claim. A processing form shall be sent to you upon receipt of your email confirming your readiness to work with this office to have your funds released to your account.\n\nYou will be required to complete the form and return it back to this office for immediate processing of your payment documents and once documents are processed and issued to you, original copies will be sent to the bank for onward transfer to be carried out to your account.\n\nReconfirm the receipt of this email immediately with your full NAMES, COMPLETE ADDRESS & TELEPHONE NUMBER. This information will be used for the processing of the payment documents which shall begin immediately we receive your response. As part of our commitment, the United Kingdom HM treasury has instructed us to attach a copy of our working ID to beneficiaries to enable them know who they are dealing with also this is to reduce the fear which beneficiaries have in dealing with some officials regarding their payments. \n\nNote that you MUST call us on the above number for confirmation advice as this office is working in all areas to make sure that transfer is made without any further delay. \n\nThanking you for letting us serve you better. \n\nYours faithfully\nMr. James Peck\nDirector Foreign Payment Dept.\nLondon-United Kingdom",
