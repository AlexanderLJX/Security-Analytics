Hello Friend

Re: Your Package for Delivery
I have very vital information for you , but first I must have your trust before I review it because it may cause me my job, I am Mr.Donald Boma, Delivering Agent here at Midland Airport Texas USA, During my recent withheld package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from Africa and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 110kg.

The consignment was abandoned because the contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as MONEY rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation, and inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non (NIC) Inspection Charges which is $3,250 USD.

On my assumption the consignment is still left in our Storage Vault here at the Midland International air port till date, the details of the consignment including your name, your email address tagged with the Trunk box. However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment, as the delivering Agent Officer, I will advise you provide your Current Address, Scan copy of your ID to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the details tagged.

Note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Department or to its country of origin as unclaimed delivery, everything will be concluded within 48hours upon your acceptance and I will proceed to your address for delivery.

Lastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want us to transact this deal and share the money 75% for you and 25% for me since the consignment have not yet been return to the United States Treasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat.

Upon receipt of your response, I will go ahead and pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee $3,750 dollars and arrange for the box to be delivery to your doorstep Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 250% share.

I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and I will appreciate if we can keep this deal confidential.

Please get back to me via my private Email (inquiry.officeoo12@gmail.com ) for further directives:

Thank you.
