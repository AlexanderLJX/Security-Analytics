However, the multi-party internal distribution, consistent corporate context, and realistic names/roles (Louise Kitchen, Greg Whalley, John Lavorato, Kevin Presto) align with known Enron history and reduce spoofing likelihood.\n- No mismatched display name vs. address, no odd external domains masquerading as Enron/UBS.\n\n2) URL Analysis (suspicious links, redirects, homoglyphs)\n- Only URL: http://www.ubswarburg.com (spaced formatting).

' if found guilty , meyer could have been fined or even sent to jail . the states had passed these laws essentially with the german language as the target , america had just finished a war with germany and there was a hatred of germany and things german , particularly its military values , ideals and political institutions . the law reflected the widespread belief that the german language was the embodiment of all that was evil in german culture and that to teach such a language to young americans would be immoral and corrupting . meyer decided to appeal his case to the supreme court of the state of nebraska . ironically , lawyers for the state of nebraska took essentially the position presented in the german language by the german philosopher , wilhelm von humboldt , in 1836 . that is , a language by its very nature represents the spirit and national character of a people . if this were true , then by teaching them the grammar , structure and vocabulary of the german language , meyer could indeed have been harming american children by making them into german militarists right there on the plains of nebraska . the nebraska supreme court denied meyer 's appeal , but meyer did not submit . he then took his case to the highest court in the country , the united states supreme court , where he won his case . that court overturned his conviction and declared unconstitutional all laws in the united states which forbade the teaching of a foreign language . in its 1922 ruling the court stated as one basis for its decision . ' mere knowledge of the german language cannot reasonably be regarded as harmful . ' we see in this story that a seemingly purely theoretical issue can have very practical consequences in everyday life . in making a legal decision on the matter , the court also made a psycholinguistic decision , on the relationship of language , thought and culture . was the court correct ? it is this question that we shall now consider .

Without sender/domain authentication data or thread context, a small residual risk remains (e.g., a compromised account replying within an existing thread). If this message is unexpected or from an unknown contact, verify via a known channel before acting; otherwise, it appears benign."

    "initial_reasoning": "Here\u2019s a focused security review of the provided message.\n\n1) Sender Authentication\n- Domains and addressing: The addresses use Enron/Lotus Notes\u2013style routing (e.g., \u201c/ hou / ect @ ect\u201d, \u201c/ enron @ enron\u201d, \u201c/ ees @ ees\u201d), which is consistent with internal Enron messages from that era. There are no obvious external domains or lookalike/homoglyph domains.\n- Spoofing indicators: No display-name spoofing, no mismatched Reply-To, and the thread shows a believable internal forward chain (\u201cForwarded by Vance L Taylor\u2026\u201d with numerous internal recipients).\n- Caveat: We lack headers, so SPF/DKIM/DMARC can\u2019t be verified. Based on structure/content, it appears to be an internal, legitimate message.\n\n2) URL Analysis\n- No URLs present. No link shorteners, redirects, or homoglyph domains to assess.\n\n3) Social Engineering\n- Tone and content: Routine operational instructions (create a ticket in Sitara, track in IM Wellhead portfolio). No fear appeals, gift offers, credential prompts, or financial diversion.\n- Urgency: Minimal. Words like \u201cshould be created\u201d reflect normal workflow, not manufactured urgency.\n- Authority: Internal colleagues referencing specific systems and deal details. This aligns with normal business context rather than abuse of authority.\n\n4) Technical Indicators\n- Formatting/grammar: The odd spacing/punctuation likely result from archiving/extraction (common in historical Enron datasets), not a phishing marker. The message body is coherent and domain-specific.\n- Thread continuity: Includes a forward from Esther Buckley to a large internal distro, which is typical of internal operational notices.\n- No signs of mass-market phishing templates, tracking pixels, or nonstandard footers.\n\n5) Content Analysis\n- Requests: Operational tasks only (create a ticket, track deal). No requests for credentials, MFA codes, personal data, or payment/banking changes.\n- Attachments: Mentions an attached letter and references to a gathering contract. Attachments are the primary residual risk (macro malware) if this were received externally or out of expected context. However, given the internal context and the domain-specific nature (deal #643714, Sitara, producer services, wellhead portfolio), it appears routine.\n- No cryptocurrency mentions or unusual payment instructions.\n\nClassification: LEGITIMATE\n\nReasoning: The message is consistent with an internal, operational business email: internal addressing format, realistic deal/system references (Sitara, IM Wellhead portfolio), normal tone, and no links or credential/payment requests. The only residual risk is the generic \u201cplease see attached letter,\u201d which should still be handled with standard caution.\n\nRecommended precautions\n- If you must open the attachment: Verify the sender via a known internal channel if the email was unexpected. Open attachments in a sandbox or with macros disabled. Ensure endpoint protection is active.\n- If available, review message headers to confirm internal routing and alignment with the directory entries for the named senders (Vance L Taylor, Esther Buckley).\n- Cross-check the deal/ticket details in Sitara to confirm legitimacy before acting.",

There are no obvious external domains or lookalike/homoglyph domains.\n- Spoofing indicators: No display-name spoofing, no mismatched Reply-To, and the thread shows a believable internal forward chain (\u201cForwarded by Vance L Taylor\u2026\u201d with numerous internal recipients).\n- Caveat: We lack headers, so SPF/DKIM/DMARC can\u2019t be verified. Based on structure/content, it appears to be an internal, legitimate message.\n\n2) URL Analysis\n- No URLs present. No link shorteners, redirects, or homoglyph domains to assess.\n\n3) Social Engineering\n- Tone and content: Routine operational instructions (create a ticket in Sitara, track in IM Wellhead portfolio). No fear appeals, gift offers, credential prompts, or financial diversion.\n- Urgency: Minimal. Words like \u201cshould be created\u201d reflect normal workflow, not manufactured urgency.\n- Authority: Internal colleagues referencing specific systems and deal details. This aligns with normal business context rather than abuse of authority.\n\n4) Technical Indicators\n- Formatting/grammar: The odd spacing/punctuation likely result from archiving/extraction (common in historical Enron datasets), not a phishing marker. The message body is coherent and domain-specific.\n- Thread continuity: Includes a forward from Esther Buckley to a large internal distro, which is typical of internal operational notices.\n- No signs of mass-market phishing templates, tracking pixels, or nonstandard footers.\n\n5) Content Analysis\n- Requests: Operational tasks only (create a ticket, track deal). No requests for credentials, MFA codes, personal data, or payment/banking changes.\n- Attachments: Mentions an attached letter and references to a gathering contract. Attachments are the primary residual risk (macro malware) if this were received externally or out of expected context. However, given the internal context and the domain-specific nature (deal #643714, Sitara, producer services, wellhead portfolio), it appears routine.\n- No cryptocurrency mentions or unusual payment instructions.\n\nClassification: LEGITIMATE\n\nReasoning: The message is consistent with an internal, operational business email: internal addressing format, realistic deal/system references (Sitara, IM Wellhead portfolio), normal tone, and no links or credential/payment requests. The only residual risk is the generic \u201cplease see attached letter,\u201d which should still be handled with standard caution.\n\nRecommended precautions\n- If you must open the attachment: Verify the sender via a known internal channel if the email was unexpected. Open attachments in a sandbox or with macros disabled. Ensure endpoint protection is active.\n- If available, review message headers to confirm internal routing and alignment with the directory entries for the named senders (Vance L Taylor, Esther Buckley).\n- Cross-check the deal/ticket details in Sitara to confirm legitimacy before acting."

URL Analysis\n- Links present: None provided.\n- Assessment: No URLs to analyze (no redirects, tracking parameters, or homoglyphs observed). If the original email contained hidden/invisible links, inspect the raw HTML source to confirm.\n\n3. Social Engineering\n- Urgency/fear/authority: None. No call to action, deadlines, threats, or impersonation of a trusted brand.\n- Pretext: The phrase appears machine-generated or like a debug/notification string; no manipulative language.\n\n4. Technical Indicators\n- Grammar/formatting: \u201chourahead hour : 16\u201d looks like a system variable or log output (odd spacing before colon, lower-case tokens). This pattern is common in automated notifications or misconfigured systems, not typical phishing lures.\n- Pattern: Extremely minimal content; could be a test message, cron/scheduler output, or placeholder from a script.\n\n5. Content Analysis\n- Requests for info: None.\n- Attachments: None mentioned.\n- Financial/crypto: None.\n- Sensitive data prompts: None.\n\nClassification: LEGITIMATE (low confidence due to missing header/sender data)\n\nReasoning: The message lacks hallmark phishing elements (no links/attachments, no urgency, no requests, no impersonation). Its content resembles an automated or misconfigured system notification. Without headers, definitive authentication checks aren\u2019t possible, but there are no active threat indicators in the provided snippet.\n\nIf you want higher confidence:\n- Provide full headers to verify SPF/DKIM/DMARC and domain alignment.\n- Confirm sender identity (does it come from an internal system or expected service?).\n- Check if similar automated messages are routinely received from a known tool (scheduler/monitoring system)."

While atypical for formal comms, it\u2019s common in casual internal/academic notes and older emails.\n- No branding imitation, no mismatched logos, no formatting tricks.\n- No suspicious attachments or HTML forms.\n\n5) Content Analysis\n- Purely informational: \u201chere is this prof\u2019s home page\u2026 his name is richard baraniuk.\u201d\n- No requests for credentials, payments, gift cards, crypto, or sensitive data.\n- No attachments; only a link to an academic-looking page (~richb personal directory is a common convention on university servers).\n\nClassification: LEGITIMATE (low risk)\n\nReasoning: The domain is a valid .edu for Rice University with a plausible research-group host, the content is benign and non-coercive, and there are no common phishing markers (no credential/payment requests, no urgency, no deceptive formatting). The only mild concerns are the informal style and use of HTTP, which are not, by themselves, indicators of phishing.\n\nSafety recommendations (if you choose to visit):\n- Manually type the normalized URL (www-dsp.rice.edu/~richb) into your browser or navigate from the main rice.edu site to the professor\u2019s page to avoid any hidden-link tricks.\n- Prefer HTTPS if available (try https://www-dsp.rice.edu/~richb/); check the certificate and that the address bar shows rice.edu.\n- Alternatively, search \u201cRichard Baraniuk Rice University homepage\u201d and follow links from rice.edu to confirm.\n- If this came unexpectedly, you can confirm with the sender via a known, separate channel."

Remain cautious of any links in follow-up messages.\n\n3) Social Engineering\n- Urgency/pressure: States the transaction can conclude within 14 days to push quick compliance.\n- Emotional manipulation: Orphan narrative, father poisoned by associates\u2014a classic sympathy ploy.\n- Greed/reciprocity: Promises 30% of $7.5M to entice cooperation.\n- Authority/legitimacy: Claims of wealth, \u201cbig bank,\u201d inheritance, foreign investment\u2014vague yet grandiose to appear credible.\n- Isolation tactic: Requests direct personal details to continue privately.\n\n4) Technical Indicators\n- Grammar/formatting: Numerous errors and odd capitalization (\u201cGood-day,\u201d \u201cMr.and Mrs.Abraham,\u201d \u201cunited state dollars,\u201d \u201cHe instructed me That\u201d), inconsistent spacing and punctuation\u2014strong indicators of mass scam templates.\n- Style/patterns: Hallmarks of \u201c419\u201d advance-fee fraud\u2014large inheritance, West African setting, urgent partner needed, generous cut offered.\n\n5) Content Analysis\n- Information requests: Asks for occupation, age, nationality, and phone number\u2014PII harvesting that can lead to identity theft or further social engineering.\n- Financial setup: Seeks assistance to move $7.5M and use your bank account\u2014typical precursor to requests for \u201cprocessing fees,\u201d \u201ctaxes,\u201d or \u201cclearance charges.\u201d\n- Attachments/crypto: None mentioned; no explicit cryptocurrency references. Expect future requests for bank details or scans of ID.\n\nClassification: PHISHING (Advance-Fee Fraud/419)\nReasoning: The email exhibits multiple strong indicators of advance-fee fraud\u2014implausible inheritance story, urgent timeline, promise of a large payout, request for personal information, poor grammar/formatting, and lack of verifiable sender identity or domain. Even without links or attachments, the content is designed to elicit a reply and escalate to money and data extraction. Do not respond or provide any information."

I decided to contact you to help me actualise this business for the mutual benefit of both our families. My name is Mr. Gilbson Mouka the Auditing and Accounting section manager in Banque Regionale de solidarite Burkina Faso (BRS BANK), there is one of our customers who have made fixed deposit of sum of ($39.5)million for 7 years and upon maturity; I sent the notification to his address, but no response. After few months, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his business partner that he died after a brief illness in his country. We tried everything humanly possible to locate his relatives or family, but all efforts failed. The deposit is still intact with my bank and the interest is being paid into the principal sum at the end of each year.\n\nIf the fund remains in the account for more months, the fund will be confiscated and transferred into the treasury of the Government as unclaimed funds. This is why I contact you for joining hands with the honesty and truth to ensure that the fund is transferred into your bank account, a bank account anywhere in the world can help the transfer. All that is required of you is to contact my bank with the information I will send you as the next of kin or a business associate of the depositor with this system the fund will be paid into a bank account you will provide to the bank. To be honest with you, this is totally legal and 100% risk free.\n\nBut the secret must remain between you and me, I can assure you that I have worked with this bank for many years and I know all the secrets and I have carefully mapped out my perfect strategies to handle this operation successfully. The depositor is my close friend before his death that is the main reason why I'm the only one working at the bank here that knows much about the existence of this fund and the secrets and the depositor. We will also use some part of the funds to help the orphanage and less privileged children in the world.\n\nPlease keep this proposal as a secret between us and delete it immediately in your mail box if you are not interested. But if you are interested give me an answer immediately.\n\nI await your response. Mr. Gilbson Mouka.",

Please listen to this,i have my late father's statement of account and death certificate (as his next of kin)here with me which i will send to you latter,because when he was alive he deposited some amount of money in a leading bank in United kingdom which he used my name as the next of kin,the amount in question is $7.5m(Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) So what i need from you is, for you to see that this money is transferred to  a good account and also to make arrangement on how i will come over and stay with you and continue my life and education. My choosing you is a question i knew you must ask and i think it is a good question.i have two reasons for choosing you, i choosed you because it is the will of  God.and i believe knowing you will bring hope back again to my life.my choosing you does not mean i do not have anybody from Africa.i have two uncles,that is my late fathers junior brothers whom i think are suppose to be taking care of me but they do not care,all they did was to sell my late father's houses and company to one Mr Olson Steven from united states and enjoy the money with their wives. I wanted to tell Olson about it but should my uncles know of the money,they can kill me ,so as to eat the money,it was as if my father saw their deed because he told the implication of having a big money in Africa and that was the reason while he made the deposit in Scotland.the day i wrote you first,i picked up three address from a dating site and i prayed over it with my Rev,father.he broth a pieces of paper and wrote the three email address in it and fold it,he ask me to pick one and i picked your email address,then i decided to write you and i also believe that it is the will of God. However you can call me with the reverend office phone line, my favorite language is English but our official language is French ,but i speak English very fluently because i attended an American and English speaking private school in my country for almost all my school,I will like you to send me some of your pictures and also try to call me as requested so that we can hear each other voices,i have a lot to tell,i will be thinking about you so much,as i will be waiting to hear from you soonest,\nhave a wonderful day,\nMiss Jessica.",

I have since placed this fund on what we call SUSPENSE ACCOUNT without any beneficiary but I discovered at last that it was an excess profit from our bank which nobody is aware of.\n\nAs an official of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this fund so I finally came in conclusion of contacting you for us to carry out the deal together so that you can assist me and receive this fund into your bank account for us to share. Meanwhile, you will have 50% of the total fund. Note that there are practically no risk involved, it will be bank to bank transfer.\n\nAll I desire from you is to stand claim as the original depositor of this fund who made the deposit with our branch so that my head office can order the transfer to your designated bank account with my recommendation as officer in-charge. I will explain more to you as I wait to receive your reply soonest.\n\nBest regards,\nDr Peter Tung Shun:",

The \u201cCopyright 2014\u201d footer looks like a pasted template often used in scams.\n\n2) URL Analysis\n- Visible links: None shown in the body you provided, except a mention of an unsubscribe link (not displayed).\n- Risk: \u201cUnsubscribe\u201d links in unsolicited job emails often lead to tracking pages, data-harvesting forms, or redirects. Watch for:\n  - URL shorteners or odd TLDs\n  - Typosquats/homoglyphs (e.g., lynx-myst\u0435ry with a Cyrillic \u201ce\u201d)\n  - Mismatch between visible text and actual link\nIf present, hover to preview and verify the root domain before clicking; ideally, do not click at all.\n\n3) Social Engineering\n- Lures: Unsolicited job opportunity, \u201cbased on your credentials\u201d but not personalized; \u201cearn extra cash,\u201d flexible, part-time\u2014classic job-scam hooks.\n- Authority appeal: \u201cI have been hired to find qualifying individuals\u201d without naming the client or recruiter. Vague and non-committal.\n- Urgency/pressure: Subtle pressure to reply quickly to be \u201cconsidered,\u201d common in recruitment scams.\n\n4) Technical Indicators\n- Grammar/formatting: Awkward phrasing, random double spaces, inconsistent capitalization/punctuation, and generic boilerplate.\n- Content inconsistency: Mentions \u201cprofit recovery service\u201d but pivots to \u201cmystery shopping\u201d\u2014signals a copy-paste template.\n- Missing compliance markers: No physical mailing address, phone, or identifiable sender; outdated \u201cC Copyright 2014\u201d is suspicious.\n\n5) Content Analysis\n- Information requests: Asks you to reply to proceed; typical next steps in these scams include requests for personal data (DOB, address, SSN), direct deposits, or sending counterfeit checks and asking you to buy gift cards/crypto or wire funds.\n- Attachments: None here, but follow-up messages may include malicious attachments or links to data-collection forms.\n- No crypto mention currently, but gift card/check scams are common with \u201cmystery shopper\u201d themes.\n\nClassification: PHISHING (Job/Recruitment Scam)\n\nReasoning: The email is unsolicited, vague, and generic, lacks verifiable sender identity and company details, contains template-like and outdated content, and uses common job-scam lures (easy money, flexible hours, quick interview). The \u201cunsubscribe\u201d mention without visible, reputable links further raises suspicion. Mystery shopper scams are a well-known fraud pattern.\n\nWhat to do next (safely):\n- Do not reply or click any links. Do not provide personal or financial information.\n- If curious, independently search for the company via your browser, locate its official careers page/contact, and verify the opportunity directly (not via any info in this email).\n- If available, inspect headers for SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment and whether the From domain matches the claimed company.\n- Report as phishing to your mail provider and, if applicable, to your organization\u2019s security team."

This is PII harvesting that often precedes identity theft or \u201cadvance-fee\u201d demands (e.g., \u201crelease fees,\u201d \u201ctax,\u201d or \u201cclearance\u201d costs).\n- No attachments in this email, but the next step typically involves sending IDs, bank details, and paying fees.\n- No crypto mention here, but the same scam pattern often pivots to wire/transfer or crypto later.\n\nClassification: PHISHING\n\nReasoning: The email exhibits multiple high-confidence phishing/advance\u2011fee (419) indicators: unsolicited promise of a large sum, urgency and confiscation threat, authority impersonation (IMF/Ecobank), request for PII, poor grammar/formatting, and lack of verifiable sender/domain. The IMF does not disburse personal inheritances or \u201cunpaid contracts\u201d via random email requests.\n\nRecommended action: Do not reply or provide any information. Mark as spam/phishing and delete. If you interacted, monitor accounts, consider a fraud alert/credit freeze, and report to your mail provider and relevant authorities (e.g., local cybercrime unit, FTC/reportfraud.ftc.gov in the U.S.)."

    "email": "Good Day,\n\nI am Mrs. Susan White, married to Late Engr  Mr. Michelle White {PhD} who worked with MULTINATIONAL OIL COMPANY EXXON AS A DRILLING RIG SUPPLIER in UAE (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) for 17 years he died on 31st July 2001 on a plane crash with other passengers, We were married for twenty four years without a child. Before his death, he deposited the sum of {7.100,000.00 million US Dollar} with a bank and this fund is presently with the bank awaiting my disbursement as  beneficiary and next of kin to the funds. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 4 months due to cancer Problem. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a Charity organization or good person that will use this fund to build an orphanage home which was the dream of my late husband. l took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit his money. I kept this deposit secret till date; this is why I am taking this decision. I don't think I will need any telephone communication in this regard because of the confidentiality of this transfer. Upon your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank. I will also issue a letter of authorization to the bank that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money.\n\nI am very grateful to you for the interest shown in my plight and I want to assure you that you will be greatly rewarded for what you have chosen to do. Although we are knowing each other for the first time but I believe God has directed me to you as I prayed and searched over the internet for assistance because I saw your profile on Microsoft EMAIL owners list and picked you. Be assured you stand no risk as this is my money, I and my late husband labored for it and me as the next of kin has the sole power to donate the funds to whoever I want. I am a religious women and take delight only in the things of God and I have prayed a lot on this already and I believe so much in the manifestation of God that I know he will not fail me and I want you to know that you have to be strong in your faith as he {God} will surely strengthen you. My husband's relatives will misuse this fund because they have sold my entire late husband's wealth and property left behind. they have sold virtually all we have in Australia, Mal\n\nAll I need is your absolute trust, commitment, confidentiality and honesty because I want to see my late husband's vision fulfilled before I leave this sinful world. My spirit directed me to you as I prayed and searched over the internet for someone to help me since I can no longer trust my family members and friends and I do not want this particular deposit to be used for things of the world. I will want you to get back to me that you will be absolutely honest about this transaction and you will use this money to the Glory of God. Also you have to assure me you will keep this transaction confidential and you will be willing to contact the finance firm which is located in (United Kingdom) and finalize all necessary formalities as to the release of the fund to you.\n\nI will also want to know a little more about you regarding your life, your spiritual life what you do for a living so as for me to know you well. I require your urgent response, if you are trustworthy and willing to help me finalize this transaction that I will immediately write my chamber to prepare a court injunction/power of attorney making you beneficiary to my fund ,some copy of other documents are with the finance firm as I sent it to them for safe keeping so my family members will not lay their hands on it. To prepare this document I will require your full names and full address. With this document you will contact the finance firm to arrange the transfer of the fund to you. As soon as you have received the fund then you will help me set up charity or distribute it to charity organizations and hospitals. I pray to be alive when you receive this fund and start this project so that you can visit me here if you wish to.\n\nI will be very happy if you can stand and fulfill this work of God wish you have been called to do.\n\nRegards\nMrs. Susan White",

    "email": "FOREIGN PAYMENTS DEPARTMENT\nSt James's Park Underground Station\n55 Broadway London SW1H 0BD United Kingdom\nTel/Fax: 44-702 409 3646\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFirst we wish to thank you for your immediate response regarding the transfer of $7,900,000.00 (Seven Million Nine Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) only which Mr. Tim Mallet of Ontario Canada claims to be your true representative.\n\nNote that we have had several attempts by some people to divert the funds from your name to their names and all claimed that they were sent by you and when we request for the documents issued to them by you, they never return back.\n\nWe made this contact to you believing that you will use this opportunity to help us serve you better. So much have been said and done on this particular payment and because you have not been here personally to sort this issue out, a lot of top officials have used that opportunity to trade with your payment thereby making so much profit at the New York Stock Exchange. Your payment has long been approved for transfer to you but because of the greed that exist in the lives of the Directors and top officials in Africa and parts of Europe, they have refused to release the funds to you because they are making profit with it from the stock trade.\n\nThis was confirmed by the HM treasury of the United Kingdom and immediately, a recall was placed for the funds to be repatriated for onward transfer to the actual Beneficiaries and that prompted us to contact you for your transfer. Note importantly that most Beneficiaries are not even aware that they have funds left somewhere. Some as a result of lottery, inheritance funds which was traced to their root from the Holocaust Victims.\n\nThe above sum is scheduled to be in your account before the next 72 hours from now only if you will adhere to our advice and instructions. Note that these people involved are working seriously to have the funds in their possession and we believe that it will be your duty to work harder and make sure that what is due to you is released to your account without any further delay.\n\nThe above amount is what has been approved to be paid to you and we advice you to accept it either as full payment or part payment now that it is available as many have ended up not receiving a dime after much time and efforts. Our office is dedicated to serving you as we have been mandated to make sure that all Beneficiaries who comply with the directives are paid without any further delay. This transfer has been proven legal and all legal documents will be processed and issued in your name as the final recipient and after that is done, no one will be able to lay claims on the funds.\n\nThe most important aspect is the communication areas which must be effective by telephone and email until transfer is made to your account as you are not to allow anyone have information of your payment to avoid any double claim. A processing form shall be sent to you upon receipt of your email confirming your readiness to work with this office to have your funds released to your account.\n\nYou will be required to complete the form and return it back to this office for immediate processing of your payment documents and once documents are processed and issued to you, original copies will be sent to the bank for onward transfer to be carried out to your account.\n\nReconfirm the receipt of this email immediately with your full NAMES, COMPLETE ADDRESS & TELEPHONE NUMBER. This information will be used for the processing of the payment documents which shall begin immediately we receive your response. As part of our commitment, the United Kingdom HM treasury has instructed us to attach a copy of our working ID to beneficiaries to enable them know who they are dealing with also this is to reduce the fear which beneficiaries have in dealing with some officials regarding their payments. \n\nNote that you MUST call us on the above number for confirmation advice as this office is working in all areas to make sure that transfer is made without any further delay. \n\nThanking you for letting us serve you better. \n\nYours faithfully\nMr. James Peck\nDirector Foreign Payment Dept.\nLondon-United Kingdom",
